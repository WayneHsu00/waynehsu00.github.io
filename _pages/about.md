<!--my introduction start-->

👨‍🎓 I am a PhD candidate in **Management Science and Engineering** at the **Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences** (<a href="http://www.casisd.cn/" target="_blank">CASISD</a>), dedicated to advancing knowledge and solutions in this dynamic field.

🔍 My research centers on **Risk Management**, where I explore innovative approaches to risk assessment and management, aiming to develop practical frameworks that address complex challenges in diverse sectors.

💻 Beyond research, I have a strong interest in **programming** and **software development**. I enjoy using these skills to develop **practical tools** that solve real-world problems. I am also a strong advocate for **open-source technologies** and actively contribute to and learn from the open-source community, believing in the power of collaboration and shared knowledge.

✍️ As an advocate for knowledge sharing, I regularly publish articles and insights on my <a href="https://waynehsucn.github.io/blog/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>. It's a space where I document my research progress, share technical tutorials, and reflect on emerging trends in technology and management.

🌐 Collaboration and communication are at the heart of my work. Whether you have a question, idea, or opportunity to collaborate, feel free to reach out—I’d love to [connect](mailto:wenjie.xu.cn@outlook.com)!
